# sMACk
Explanation of App
sMACk is a dating app exclusively created for the Macalester student body. It is built using django, html, css, and javascript. The app allows users to sign up for an account, which includes many different fields that are specifically catered to Macalester students. Then it creates a score depending on how the user has answered the questions on the sign up sheet. Once the account is established, users can see other profiles either in the friend feed or the dating feed as well as how compatible they are with the user based on the compatibility score. The user has the option to like ("smack dat") a user in the feed or dislike ("no thanks"). If both users like eath other, then their emails are visible so that the users can contact each other.

Then open a web browser and navigate to the website the command prompt states to start the application.
